#  Celebrating 450 yrs of Tycho's Nova Stella

On November 1572, the observation of a «Nova Stella» in the Cassiopeia constellation and the extensive work by Tycho Brahe are one of the founding events of modern astronomy. The appearance of a new star challenged the immutability of the realm of stars, boosted the need for stellar catalogs with higher astrometric precision and the development of better observing instruments. Centuries after the explosion, the remnants of supernovae are still a driver to explore many key astrophysics questions from the understanding of the mechanisms of the supernova explosion, the nucleosynthesis processes, the mechanisms of particle acceleration at shocks, to the SN impacts onto the circumstellar and interstellar media.

In the last decades, the current generation of ground and space based telescopes have provided a major step forward in the understanding of the physics of supernova remnants (SNRs). As we enter a new era of discovery with the recently launched eROSITA X-ray survey telescope, new generation radio facilities and upcoming facilities such as the James Webb Telescope, the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) with high-resolution imaging spectroscopy and the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) in gamma-rays, now is the time to review our current understanding of the key questions in SNR physics. In parallel, numerical simulations of the particle acceleration processes are producing increasingly detailed predictions and supernova simulations are bridging the gap between the supernova and the remnant which can be compared with multi-wavelength observations.
